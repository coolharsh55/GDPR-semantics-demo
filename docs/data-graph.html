   <h2>consent collection dialogue</h2>
   <p>The consent collection dialogue on quantcast.com, as seen in Fig 1., starts with a "I Agree" and "Show Purposes". You can use the Web Archive version of this page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190430014325/https://www.quantcast.com/">here</a>.</p>

    <figcaption><center>Fig 1: First screen in the Quantcast consent dialogue</center></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Clicking on "I Accept" assumes that the user has consented to all purposes and choices. This is evident by clicking on the "Change Consent" item at the bottom in the footer, and going into "Show Purposes" where all options have been pre-selected, as seen in Fig 2.</p>
  <blockquote>NOTE: We avoided the interpretation of whether the "I Accept" button fails some consent requirements such as not having options pre-ticked or pre-chosen by default. We focused on the modeling of options provided, with the <code>ManualTest</code> constraints responsible for this qualitative assessment.</blockquote>

  <h3>Extracting Purposes, Processing, and Personal Data</h3>
  <p>Clicking on "Show Purposes" in the first screen (Fig 1.) takes the user to a second screen where various options are presented along with descriptions, as seen in Fig 3.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="quantcast_consent_info.png" alt="quantcast-consent-screen">
    <figcaption><center>Fig 3: Consent choices after clicking on "Show Purposes" before "I Agree"</center></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The second screen lists items such as "Information storage and access" along with a description next to a radio button that is off by default. We interpret the title as a purpose, and collect processing and personal data from the descriptions. Purposes are defined as both <code>gdprov:Process</code> and <code>gc:Purpose</code>, with processing defined as <code>gdprov:Step</code> and gc:Processing, and personal-data are defined using gdprov:PersonalData and gc:PersonalData. A list of purposes, processing, and personal data extracted from the consent dialogue are provided in Table 1.</p>
  <p>For personal data mentioned in the consent dialogue, we indicated the source of this data as the user by defining a <code>gdprov:DataCollectionStep</code> that generates or collects this data.

  <h3>Extracting Third-Parties</h3>
  <p>About halfway through the dialogue, a separate list of purposes associated with third-parties is provided, called "Third Party Vendors". Below the radio button, there is a "View Companies" link, which when clicked, expands the list of companies (third parties) associated with that purpose, as seen in Fig 4.</p>

    <img src="quantcast_third_parties.png" alt="quantcast-consent-screen">
    <figcaption><center>Fig 4: Third Parties associated with Purpose in consent screen</center></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Clicking on the radio button is indicated to provide consent to all third parties as evidenced by the fact that individual third parties cannot be (de-)selected. Therefore, all third parties associated with a single purpose were represented using a single data sharing operation that shared data with ALL third parties listed. A list of purposes and third parties extracted from the consent dialogue are provided in Table 2. The third parties were defined using <code>gdprov:ThirdParty</code> and <code>gc:ThirdParty</code>. To associate them as data recipients for the specified third party, they were linked to a <code>gdprov:DataSharingStep</code> and <code>gc:DataStep</code> using the property <code>gc:SharesDataWithThirdParty</code>.</p>

<h3>Representing Consent Choices</h3>
    <p>To represent the choices/options offered, the consent dialogue was defined using <code>gc:Consent</code> and <code>gdprov:ConsentAgreementTemplate</code>. Additionally, to signify multiple consent choices offered in the same dialogue (since the user could selectively give consent to each choice), the consent dialogue was defined as <code>gdprov:ConsentAgreementTemplateBundle</code>. Each 'choice' was defined as a <code>gdprov:ConsentTemplate</code>, as well as <code>gc:Consent</code> with the status <code>gc:ConsentStatusRequested</code>.</p>
    <p>An example of the complete representation of information from the consent dialogue is provided in the Listing 1.</p>

  <h2>Gathering more information from website</h2>
  <p>Additional information was collected by visiting the other pages on the website. These included information about the various products and services offered by Quantcast, as well as the privacy policy outlining data protection requirements of the organisation.</p>
  <h3>Information about products and services</h3>
  <p>Quantcast has five (broadly specifying) products/services listed on its website - <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/products/measure-audience-insights-dep/">Measure</a>, <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/products/insights/">Insights</a>, <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/products/targeting-overview/">Targeting</a>, <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/products/measurement/">Measurement</a>, and <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/gdpr/consent-management-solution/">Quantcast Choice</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Measure</b> is a free service that provides analytics regarding audience (visitors) to websites. It specifically mentions Demographics (age, gender, family, location, income, education, and occupation), Psychographics (purchase history, brand preference, cars driven, media consumption), Engagement (categorise visitors as passers-by, regulars, and fanatics), and Traffic (platform - web and mobile web, country, time period). Of these, we included data categories and types for Demographics and Psychographics in the data graph. We did not indicate their source as Quantcast does not provide any explicit information regarding the same on its website. For Psychographics, Quantcast specifies that it uses information from third-parties (Experian, Mastercard, DLX, TiVo, and Netwise) to 'augment' its profiles. We added the source for this data using this information. </p>
  <p>The webpage provides a broad categorisation of such profiles in the form of Shopping Interests, Media Interests, Business & Occupation, Geography, and Political Interests. We added this as personal data by creating a subclass of <code>gdprov:PersonalData</code> for Demograhics and Psychographics, and defining each type as instances of this, including profiles. An example is provided in Listing 2.</p>

<caption><center>Listing 3: Data Step for use of profiles in Measure and Advertise</center></caption>
  <p><b>Targeting</b> provides selecting audiences/users based on personal data attributes (similar to those in Measure). While Quantcast does not explicitly say that it uses the same personal data collected and used in Measure, we can infer that it does so based on the description. However, since we only model explicit information regarding personal data, we did not include this in our data model. The service provided by Quantcast is in essence similar to that provided by Facebook - it acts as the mediator between providers and consumers by matching the criteria to user profiles. For example, it mentions an example where the target audience is "women 18-34 who love shopping, traveling and wine", which implies that it must know about a) gender b) age range c) website history d) purchase history e) travel history, It further elaborates, "We build a custom model based on millions of available data points about your audience, such as their pre-search behaviors, demographics, and past purchases."</p>
  <blockquote>NOTE: Nowhere does Quantcase provide (explicit) information on how the consent and data associated with it is involved in its services and profiles. Quantcast clarifies that it does not collect or contain any personally identifiable information in the privacy policy. Our purpose is not a) to determine if this is correct b) to investigate how personal data is actually being collected and used. We limit our scope to model information explicitly provided on the website for clarity.</blockquote>
  <p><b>Measurement</b> is similar to Measure and Targeting in its use of audience profile, with the key difference between provision of service beyond website audiences for e.g. campaigns. It describes data categories such as Website Traffic, Demographics, Interests, Search behaviours, and Media consumption, which we have added to our data graph.</p>
  <p><b>Quantcast Choice</b> provides consent collection mechanism conformant to the <a href="https://advertisingconsent.eu/">IAB Consent and Transparency Framework</a>, and is used in the consent dialogue provided on Quantcast.</p>
  <hr/>
  <h3>Information from privacy policy</h3>
  <p>The privacy policy further provides data categories/types for Cookies, Tags, and Log data, which we added to our data graph. We also added the use and collection of emails used to contact Quantcast. The policy mentions the use of a UID for each user. Data retention periods are provided as "for as long as necessary", with a limit described for log data (13 months). As such, we have not included data storage periods in our graph.</p>
  <p>The policy describes GDPR rights regarding right to access, right to rectify, right to restrict processing, right to deletion, right to data portability, and provides <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/data-subject-rights/">this link</a> regarding contact and more information. We used this link as the IRI for these rights.</p>
  <blockquote>NOTE: In reality, we could not access the rights information page, as the notice on the webpage specified - "No cookie found: We are unable to find a Quantcast measurement cookie on your browser and therefore will be unable to identify any data in our systems or process any request for data access or deletion."</blockquote>
  <p>We used the contact information at the bottom of the policy as the IRI and information for defining the Data Protection Officier (point of contact). For this, we used <code>gdprov:DPO</code>.
